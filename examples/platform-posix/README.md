# Development environment
The program examples below are developed on macOS which is fully compliant with POSIX. Most linux systems are mostly POSIX compliant and for the most part shouldn't experience difficulties with the examples found here. Tools like `nc` and `netcat` are useful for monitoring and trying out server examples. Use `nc localhost 1500` for the server example. Result should be Hello World!. One issue that I have experienced so far is after receiving a Hello World! reply the port is temporarily still open. The solution for the time is to wait till the OS closes it due to an inactivity timeout.
